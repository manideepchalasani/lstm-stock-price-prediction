# LSTM Based Stock Price Prediction on Daily Charts 

This repository supports our published IEEE paper:
**[LSTM Based Stock Price Prediction on Daily Charts](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10627125)**

##  Overview
The paper explores stock price forecasting using LSTM neural networks. We incorporated both historical stock data and fundamental ratios (PE, PB, PS) for predicting daily closing prices of major Indian stocks â€” TCS, Reliance, and ITC.

## Methods Used
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance, Screener.in
- **Features**: PE, PB, PS Ratios + Historical Prices
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAPE
